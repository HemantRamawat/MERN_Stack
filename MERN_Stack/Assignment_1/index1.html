    <h1>Drever (Image1)</h1>
    <p style="color:  red; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: larger;">The <i><b>Drever</b></i> is a
        purebred dog from the country of Sweden. Loyal, hardworking, and alert, these pups have some of the best
        qualities of any dog around.

        Drevers go by one other name, which is Swedish Dachsbracke. Despite being from the country of Sweden, you might
        be able to find this purebred at your local shelter or breed specific rescues nearby. Remember, it’s always
        better to adopt and not shop!</p>
    <!-- <span style=" top: 100px;">There is A dog who is seeing left side</span> -->

    <h1>Valley Bulldogs (Image2)</h1>
    <p style="color: red; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: larger;">  <i><b> Valley Bulldogs </b></i> also
        go by the name Bull Boxer. Despite their unfortunate status as a designer breed, you can find these mixed pups
        in shelters and breed-specific rescues, so remember to adopt! Don’t shop!</p>
    </p>

    <h1>Australian Shepherd Pit Bull Mix (Image3)</h1>
    <p style="color: red; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: larger;"> <i><b>  The Australian
        Shepherd Pit Bull Mix </b></i> is a mixed breed dog — a cross between the Australian Shepherd and Pit Bull dog breeds.
        Energetic, loyal, and quick to learn new things, these pups inherited some of the best traits from both of their
        parents.

        Australian Shepherd Pit Bull Mixes are sometimes also called Pitbull Australian Shepherd Mixes or Aussie Pits.
        Despite their unfortunate status as a designer breed, you can find these mixed breed dogs in shelters and breed
        specific rescues, so remember to adopt! Don’t shop!</p>


    <h1>Bulldog (Image4)</h1>
    <p style="color: red; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif ; font-size: larger;"><i><b> The Bulldog</b></i> was
        originally used to drive cattle to market and to compete in a bloody sport called bullbaiting. Today, they’re
        gentle companions who love kids.

        Even though these are purebred dogs, you may find them in the care of shelters or rescue groups. Remember to
        adopt! Don’t shop if you want to bring a dog home.</p>
